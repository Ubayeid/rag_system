      "INTRODUCTION",
      "accuracy and communication of forecasted flood risks. Forecasted flood inundation maps are typically based on deterministic model output generated using a hydraulic model forced with a single discharge output from a hydrologic model (e.g., Merwade et al. 2008; Grimaldi et al. 2013). These deterministic flood inundation maps are subject to uncertainty due to imperfect forcing, initial conditions, model parameteri- zations, and numerical limitations (Merwade et al.",

      "2008; Christian et al. 2013); therefore, by not incorpo- rating these uncertainties, deterministic flood inunda- tion maps fail to communicate the full risk for potential flooding.",
      "Ensemble modeling techniques have been widely used as a method for improving forecast accuracy and for quantifying uncertainties in model predictions (Pal- mer 2000; Pappenberger et al. 2005; Pappenberger et al. 2006; Hagedorn et al. 2008; Hamill et al. 2008; Leutbecher and Palmer 2008; Cloke and Pappenberger 2009; Sanyal et al. 2010; Buahin et al. 2017). An ensemble is composed of a series of simulations pro- duced by a single underlying model to encompass the range of possible model outcomes. The greater range of outcomes, or lower agreement among members, coin- cides with higher uncertainty in the model prediction. Three common approaches to generating an ensemble are to use statistical models to generate a time-lagged ensemble (Regonda et al. 2013), perturb initial condi- tions of a single model (Toth and Kalnay 1997; Dyer et al. 2016), or vary the physics of the single model (Stensrud et al. 2000; Du et al. 2004; Dyer et al. 2016). A challenge with multi-physics ensembles is that the underlying distribution cannot be attributed to a com- mon probability density function (PDF) or climatology. As such, a change to the underlying model would not necessarily affect the members of the ensemble. Another ensemble generation approach is to generate a multimodel ensemble where the ensemble is com- posed of realizations from different models (Beven and Binley 1992; Nutter et al. 2004). A multimodel ensem- ble encounters challenges similar to the multi-physics ensemble because each model member belongs to its own PDF; however, even though each model has its own PDF, improvements to the underlying models will improve the entire framework.",
      "Hydrologic and hydraulic models include inherent uncertainty associated with input data, model parame- ters, and the structure of the models (Kauffeldt et al. 2016). Subjective choices made by the modeler in developing and calibrating the simulational frame- work may generate substantial error depending on the model (Zarriello 1998). Additionally, model calibration problems may not necessarily be addressed by better and more field data (Gupta et al. 1998). These factors make the selection of a model for a desired application quite complex. In fact, there is not a unique model that can be known as the best model for all conditions (Velazquez et al. 2010; Afshari et al. 2018). An option to account for subjectivity in model selection is to com- bine multiple and different model realizations, or a multimodel ensemble. Each model will produce specific information that can supplement the final multimodel predicted scenario (Oudin et al. 2006). This will also help eliminate some of the uncertainties by rejecting improbable output produced by a single model",
      "(Kauffeldt et al. 2016). Subjectivity is decreased with the multimodel technique because attention is directed to locations where models are in agreement. Locations where model agreement is strong translate to greater confidence in the potential for that scenario indepen- dent of a single modelers subjectivity and a single models accuracy.",
      "It is important to also consider how to communicate flood information in disseminated products. While comparing the communication of flood information as deterministic maps vs. probabilistic maps, Di Baldas- sarre et al. (2010) concluded that it is most appropriate to communicate flood maps as probabilistic surfaces given the uncertainties associated with simplifying complex river dynamics in a modeling environment. Frick and Hegg (2011) showed that the communication of forecast uncertainty improves end users situational awareness and decision making; however, there are numerous caveats that need consideration when com- municating uncertainty in hydrometeorological fore- casts (Ramos et al. 2010). Ramos et al. (2010) found that one of the most prominent caveats is the end users understanding of how to use the uncertainty information to make decisions. Even so, Ramos et al. (2010) and Frick and Hegg (2011) concluded that the communication of uncertainty using probabilistic tech- niques has the greatest potential for successful imple- mentation. Furthermore, Leedal et al. (2010) demonstrated the ability to develop and disseminate real-time probabilistic flood forecast products.",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra- tions (NOAA) Hydrologic Ensemble Forecast Service (HEFS) uses similar methods to provide this proba- bilistic uncertainty information to end users through an online graphics interface that generates products including spaghetti plots, expected values charts, exceedance probability for some variables, and current vs. historical exceedance probability distribution plots (Demargne et al. 2014). However, HEFS and other uncertainty visualization tools (e.g., Ensemble-vis: Potter et al. 2009; Noodles: Sanyal et al. 2010) are con- fronted with the paradox of decreasing the end users understanding of the situation by providing too much information.

This approach allows for the generation of numerous ensem- ble members without changing model physics schemes, allowing for a more direct assessment of individual model uncertainty.

      "DATA AND METHODS",
      "The river selected for this project is a segment of Darby Creek, located in urban Philadelphia, Pennsyl- vania, and stretching from the Mt. Moriah Cemetery to its confluence with the Delaware River (Figure 1). The floodplains of Darby Creek are highly urbanized, and have been for some time (Figures 2a and 2b). The mean slope of the river is 0.001 mm with an average width of 50 m. The length of the reach is approximately 15 km. Tidal impacts are apparent in",
      "the downstream portion of the Darby Creek segment. A previously calibrated and verified one-dimensional (1D) Hydrologic Engineering Center-River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) model for the main stem of the Delaware River from Philadelphia to Marcus Hook showed that the stage varies depending on the tidal condition (Gomez 2017).",
      "Due to the highly urbanized floodplains in the study area, it was necessary to use high-resolution elevation data to correctly represent the terrain. A high-resolu- tion (1 m) LiDAR-derived digital elevation model (DEM) obtained from the Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access was used in combination with a bathymetry dataset collected by NOAA. The river bed elevation underneath bridges was set to average bed elevation of the upstream and downstream of the bridge to ensure the connectivity of the flow from upstream to downstream.",
      "Selected Flood Event and Flow Observations",
      "The flood event that occurred on April 30, 2014 was selected to demonstrate the proposed framework. For this event, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Cobb Creek gage at Mt. Moriah Cemetery (USGS 01475548) measured the second highest streamflow on record at the gage reaching 99 m3s at 1900 EDT. The precipitation gage located at Philadelphia Inter- national Airport recorded 121.92 mm of rain during the last two days of April 2014, indicating a five-year precipitation event (according to NOAA Atlas 14).",

The 2D component of the model solves the shallow water equations over an unstructured computational mesh; this allows the user to add more detail where needed such as dikes, roads, buildings, etc. To reduce the computation time, the model uses a subgrid bathymetry approach (Casulli 2009). The subgrid approach consists of using a coarse computa- tional grid and at each cell associated properties from the underlying terrain data are precomputed, thus accounting for the fine terrain data through mass conservation.",

The cali- bration of the model was done by forcing the upstream boundary with 72-h observed flow data starting from August 29, 2009 and the stage data at the downstream boundary for the same period. The Mannings n values were adjusted to ensure the model output matched the observed water surface elevation until no further improvement was observed.",

The calibrated model was used to create two sets of maps for the selected flood event: (1) baseline flood inunda- tion maps and (2) forecast flood inundation maps (Figure 3).

Without a ground-referenced dataset of the flood extent data in the reach for this event, this flood extent map gener- ated from the observed upstream discharge data is considered the best representation of the actual flood inundation for comparison against the HEC-RAS out- put. The second set of forecast maps were obtained by forcing the model at the upstream boundary with the 11-member hydrometeorological forecast. To understand the effect of the forecast lead time on the flood maps, two separate flood inundation forecasts per member, namely the 24- and 48-h forecast flood inundation maps, were considered. These were obtained by forcing the hydraulic model with the 24- and 48-h lead time hydrometeorological ensemble streamflow forecast, respectively.",

This discrete approach was used to simplify the dissemi- nated product and increase the effectiveness of the products in risk assessment applications. The critical condition threshold was a unique variable derived with flood preparation and response efforts in mind. For example, a critical condition threshold extracted from the ensemble members identified whether conditions in a grid would exceed a water depth of 0.30 m (1 foot) and a flow velocity faster than 1.80 ms (4 milesh).

      "The numerous flood extent, water depth, flow velocity, and critical condition threshold rasters extracted from the ensemble members for the iRIC and the HEC-RAS were combined into composite threshold rasters for each of the hydraulic model out- put separately (Figure 3). Each grid cell value in the composite rasters corresponds to the percentage of ensemble member agreement that a defined threshold will be exceeded. As shown in Figure 5, this process used the binary output from the GIS postprocessed ensemble output to calculate the sum of each ensem- ble agreement in each grid cell divided by the total number of ensemble members to calculate the per- centage of ensemble agreement. This agreement also provides insight into the uncertainty of flood inunda- tion forecasts. That is, where the model ensemble member agreement is high, there is lower uncertainty that a predetermined threshold will be exceeded; where the model ensemble member agreement is low, there is higher uncertainty that a predetermined threshold will be exceeded. To help describe the uncertainty among ensemble members and the tem- poral change in uncertainty between the 24- and 48-h predictions, a nonparametric value called interquar- tile range (IQR) was used to assess the uncertainty in aerial coverage of inundation between the model ensembles and model forecast periods.",
      "Finally, the outputs from both the iRIC and the HEC-RAS ensemble members were combined into a single composite using the same procedures outlined above and in Figure 5. This procedure created the final multimodel flood inundation ensemble rasters for flood extent, water depth, flow velocity, and criti- cal conditions. From these rasters, the total ensemble agreement is used as a proxy to communicate forecast uncertainty for flood inundation extent, water depth, flow velocity, and critical conditions at each grid cell.",

      "An advantage to the multimodel ensemble approach is that each hydraulic model has its own set of ensemble members. For comparison, baseline deterministic maps of flood inundation (i.e., flood extent threshold) were created for each hydraulic model by using the observed streamflow as the input into iRIC (Figures 6a and 7a) and HEC-RAS (Fig- ures 6d and 7d). This was compared to the compos- ited flood inundation maps (i.e., flood extent threshold) output for each model that were created using the streamflow ensemble as input for iRIC (Fig- ures 6b and 7b) and HEC-RAS (Figures 6c and 7c). Greater uncertainty is illustrated in Figures 6 and 7 as green, or where there is less agreement between the ensemble members. Lower uncertainty is illus- trated as red in Figures 6 and 7, or where there is greater agreement between the ensemble members",

      "Both iRIC and HEC-RAS produced quality 24-h lead time forecasts relative to the baseline map pro- duced by each model (Figure 6). In Figure 8, all 11 ensemble members in each of the hydraulic model ensembles are in agreement that a large number of grid cells will become inundated; however, for the 24- h lead time, it is apparent that the iRIC model ensemble members have greater disagreement in those grid cells predicted to be inundated than HEC- RAS. The iRIC 24-h lead time has 4,529 grid cells where only one ensemble member predicts inunda- tion, whereas HEC-RAS has 1,040 grid cells where only one ensemble member predicts inundation. While the model agreement dropped substantially for the iRIC 48-h lead time forecast (Figure 7b), the 48-h HEC-RAS model agreement stayed relatively consis- tent with the 24-h lead time (Figure 7c). For the iRIC 48-h lead time forecast, there are 31,963 grid cells where only one ensemble member predicts the grid cells will become inundated. In contrast, the HEC- RAS 48-h lead time forecast is relatively consistent with the 24-h forecast with 608 grid cells where only",
      "one ensemble member predicts the grid cells will become inundated.",
      "The substantial increase in uncertainty during the iRIC 48-h lead time forecast is reiterated in a plot depicting the area inundated relative to each ensem- ble member (Figure 9). Predicted flood inundation area forecasted by the ensemble members was consis- tent across all members in each corresponding model ensemble except for the iRIC 48-h lead time forecast. Where the 24-h iRIC, 24-h HEC-RAS, and 48-h HEC- RAS lead time flood inundation area forecasts between ensemble members produced an IQR  0.1 km2, the IQR for the 48-h iRIC lead time forecasts was nearly 0.4 km2. This inconsistency and lower agreement translates into higher uncertainty in the iRIC 48-h lead time flood inundation forecast. The iRIC 48-h lead time ensemble members also pro- duced more widespread inundation than was fore- casted during the iRIC 24-h lead time ensemble members (Figure 9). While the uncertainty was not as pronounced for the HEC-RAS 48-h lead time ensemble members, the HEC-RAS ensemble members did produce slightly more inundation during the 48-h lead time forecasts than the 24-h lead time forecasts.",

The flood extents in Figures 10a and 10b appear similar, but the advantages of the multimodel ensemble flood inundation map can be seen when zoomed in to a commercial and residential area (Fig- ures 10c and 10d). Where it appears imminent that Locations 1, 2, and 3 will flood based on the determinis- tic flood inundation map, the actual risk of inundation is not so certain. When augmented with probability surfaces (Figures 10b and 10d), it turns out that the risk for inundation, based on ensemble agreement, is highest for Location 1, followed by Locations 2 and 3, respectively. This provides important information in the decision-making process because this may indicate that resources should be allocated to Location 1, but maybe not immediately deployed to Location 3.",

Layers produced from the numer- ous flood extent, water depth, flow velocity, and criti- cal conditions threshold rasters can be viewed by interacting with the provided radio buttons. End users are able to zoom in to areas of interest and can interact with the layers to quickly conduct a flood risk assessment for their areas of interest.",

The Flood Threat Viewer created in the current paper overlaid a flood inundation forecast with ensemble agreement (i.e., uncertainty) informa- tion to communicate a level of risk in the flood inun- dation forecast. This can be used to prioritize resources to those locations where risk for hazardous conditions is high. For example, when zoomed in to a crude oil storage tank farm, it appears that a couple of these oil tanks are at a moderate risk for flooding in the current event (Figure 11a).

      "SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS",
      "Flood inundation forecasts based on deterministic model output fail to depict the complete flood inunda- tion scenario because they do not communicate the uncertainties due to imperfect forcing, initial condi- tions, model parameterizations, and numerical limita- tions. The ensemble approach implemented in this study linked existing platforms to develop a feasible framework for augmenting flood inundation forecasts with the underlying uncertainty information. Ensem- bles were generated using a hydrometeorological fore- casting system and a hydraulic multimodel approach. Specifically, an 11-member streamflow forecast ensem- ble was used as input in two hydraulic models, iRIC and 2D HEC-RAS, to generate a range of estimates for flood extent, water depth, and flow velocity.",
      "Uncertainty was quantified by assessing the spread among ensemble members and was visualized as prob- abilistic raster surfaces. Probabilistic raster surfaces",
      "were created for numerous flood extent, water depth, flow velocity, and critical condition thresholds to com- municate the risk of exceedance for hazardous condi- tions. The final linkage in this framework was the dissemination of the output and communication of flood risk using a web-based application. Through the framework presented, it was shown how ensembles can be readily generated and incorporated into opera- tional platforms to augment deterministic forecasts with valuable uncertainty information. Therefore, by using hydrometeorological ensembles to force two dif- ferent hydraulic modeling techniques, this framework provides a viable approach for reducing modeler sub- jectivity, quantifying uncertainty, and providing flood inundation mapping products in an interactive online environment.",
      "An important outcome from this project is a frame- work that links between existing hydraulic models, GIS, and web-based application platforms. With this process now semiautomated, there are opportunities to adapt the framework to new study areas. It is also possible to change the models, add additional hydrau- lic models, or substitute an entirely different method for estimating flood inundation. For example, with the implementation of the NWM, future work can substitute the regional hydrometeorological forecast system in the framework to produce nationwide flood inundation uncertainty information.",
      "A challenge with the presented framework is that the intensive nature of the hydraulic models limits the spatial applicability of the framework; therefore,",
