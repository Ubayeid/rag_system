**Abstract:**
Accurate representation of river channel geometry is important for hydrologic and hydraulic modeling of fluvial systems. Often, channel geometry is estimated using simple rating curves that can be applied across various spatial scales. However, such methods are limited to power law relations that do not employ many potentially relevant catchment and river attributes. This paper introduce a new dataset, IFMHA (Inventory of Field Measurement of Hydraulic Attributes), to enable research studies on channel geometry and streamflow characteristics. IFMHA is derived from the National Water Information System (NWIS) site inventory for surface water field measurements and stream attributes from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). IFMHA includes 2,802,532 records from 10,050 sites (NWIS streamgaging stations). The dataset utility is demonstrated here by presenting a series of conceptual models for estimating channel geometry parameters (i.e., channel mean depth, channel maximum depth, wetted perimeter, and roughness) based on the available field attributes within IFMHA. Such a dataset and attributed channel geometry parameters can enhance the performance of operational flood forecasting frameworks (e.g. National Water Model) by providing more accurate initial conditions used in hydrologic and hydraulic routing models.
